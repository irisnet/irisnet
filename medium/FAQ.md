# IRISnet FAQ

1. What is IRISnet?

IRISnet is a service infrastructure and protocol built on top of Cosmos that facilitates construction of distributed business applications.

We are addressing the complex requirements of real-world business systems by providing key innovations including: a) collaboration of off-chain services and resources through a distributed ledger; b) integration of business services offered by heterogeneous blockchains including public chains as well as consortium chains; and c) interoperability of those services across an internet of blockchains.

2. What is the Token name of IRISnet？

IRISnet Token is IRIS.

3. What is the relationship between IRISnet and Cosmos？

While the IRIS network focuses on providing an innovative solution for distributed business applications, it is still part of the broader Cosmos network. The proposed IRISnet hub is going to be the first regional hub connecting to Cosmos main hub to add more reliability to the network. All zones connected to the proposed IRIS hub would be able to interact with any other zone in the Cosmos network over the standard IBC protocol. Furthermore, by introducing a layer of service semantics, which we believe could enable a whole new set of business scenarios, the planned IRIS network would represent an increase in scale and diversity of the Cosmos network.
