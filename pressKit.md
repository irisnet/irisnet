IRISnet: Interchain Service Hub for NextGen Distributed Applications


## About IRISnet 
(A slightly longer version)

IRISnet (a.k.a IRIS Hub) is an Interchain Service Hub designed to support the next generation of distributed applications. Built with Cosmos-SDK, IRIS Hub enables cross-chain interoperability through a unified service model, which supports not only token interchain transfer but also trustworthy data consumption and computation invocation across heterogenous systems(public blockchains, consortium blockchains and legacy systems). IRIS Hub also provides a variety of modules, such as Coin Swap, HTLC, and random numbers， to support DeFi applications. IRIS Hub is the first self evolutionary blockchain launched in the Cosmos ecosystem. 

IRISnet dev teams include Bianjie (www.bianjie.ai), a national award-winning blockchain technology team based in Shanghai, and Tendermint (https://tendermint.com), the world-famous team that created the Tendermint consensus engine and the Cosmos project.

## IRITA Hub 

IRITA Hub is the consortium interchain service Hub with similar functionalities as IRIS Hub plus additional enterprise supports including ID management, data privacy protection etc. It is a blockchain developed using IRISnet iService infrastructure. Through iService, it can efficiently support interoperability among heterogenous systems, including trustworthy on chain off chain coordination. IRITA Hub supports distributed application systems that participate in business collaboration as service consumer to efficiently call data and computing services published on IRITA Hub by other blockchains (even traditional systems) via iService. As a consortium blockchain, it also includes modules to provide id management, storage as well as auditing services etc. 

## IRITA BEAN: Blockchain Edge Analytics Network

BEAN is a distributed data analytics and exchange permissioned blockchain network, developed with the iServices framework from IRISnet. It supports privacy preserving data analysis, respects the rights of data owners, and allows auditing of data usage (more details on its business case can be found at IRISnet whitepaper). Furthermore, BEAN also enables medical data to be analyzed and exchanged freely and securely with benefits provided blockchain technology. This allows institutions, like insurance companies, hospitals as well as pharmaceutical companies, to collaborate to provide better services for patients.
